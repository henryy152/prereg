# Abstract

## Structured summary
<!--Provide a structured summary that includes (as applicable): background, objectives, eligibility criteria, sources of evidence, and charting methods that relate to the review questions and objectives.-->
Enter your respone here


# Introduction 


## Rationale 
<!--Describe the rationale for the review in the context of what is already known. Explain why the review questions/objectives lend themselves to a scoping review approach.-->
Enter your respone here

## Objectives
<!--Provide an explicit statement of the questions and objectives being addressed with reference to their key elements (e.g., population or participants, concepts, and context) or other relevant key elements used to conceptualize the review questions and/or objectives.-->
Enter your respone here


# Methods 

## Eligibility criteria
<!--Specify characteristics of the sources of evidence that will be used as eligibility criteria (e.g., years considered, language, and publication status), and provide a rationale.-->
Enter your respone here

## Information sources
<!--*Where sources of evidence are compiled from, such as bibliographic databases, social media platforms, and Web sites.
Describe all information sources in the search (e.g., databases with dates of coverage and contact with authors to identify additional sources), as well as the date the most recent search was executed-->
Enter your respone here

## Search
<!--Present the full electronic search strategy for at least 1 database, including any limits that will be used, such that it could be repeated.-->
Enter your respone here

## Selection of sources of evidence
<!--*A more inclusive/heterogeneous term used to account for the different types of evidence or data sources (e.g., quantitative and/or qualitative research, expert opinion, and policy documents) that may be eligible in a scoping review as opposed to only studies. This is not to be confused with information sources.
State the process for selecting sources of evidence (i.e., screening and eligibility) included in the scoping review.-->

# Data charting process
<!--*The frameworks by Arksey and O’Malley (
) and Levac and colleagues (
guidance (
process of data extraction in a scoping review as data charting.
) and the JBI ) refer to the

Describe the methods of charting data from the included sources of evidence (e.g., calibrated forms or forms that have been tested by the team before their use, and whether data charting will be done independently or in duplicate) and any processes for obtaining and confirming data from investigators.-->

## Data items
<!--List and define all variables for which data will be sought and any assumptions and simplifications that will be made.-->
Enter your respone here

## Critical appraisal of individual sources of evidence
<!--*The process of systematically examining research evidence to assess its validity, results, and relevance before using it to inform a decision. This term is used for this item instead of "risk of bias" (which is more applicable to systematic reviews of interventions) to include and acknowledge the various sources of evidence that may be used in a scoping review (e.g., quantitative and/or qualitative research, expert opinion, and policy document).
If done, provide a rationale for conducting a critical appraisal of included sources of evidence; describe the methods that will be used and how this information will be used in any data synthesis (if appropriate).-->
Enter your respone here

## Synthesis of results
<!--Describe the methods of handling and summarizing the data that will be charted.-->
Enter your respone here


# Other information optional
<!--(NOTE: If needed, multiple lines with other information can be included)-->


## Other information
<!--If there is any additional information that you feel needs to be included in your preregistration, please enter it here. Literature cited, disclosures of any related work such as replications or work that uses the same data, or other context that will be helpful for future readers would be appropriate here.-->
