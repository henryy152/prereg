# Hypotheses

## Description of essential elements*
<!--
        a. Describe the (numbered) hypotheses in terms of directional relationships between your (manipulated or measured) variables.
        b. For interaction effects, describe the expected shape of the interactions.
        c. If you are manipulating a variable, make predictions for unsuccessful check variables or explain why no manipulation check is included. -->

## Recommended elements
<!-- A figure or table may be helpful to describe complex interactions; this facilitates correct specification of the ordering of all group means.

File(s) selected for upload:

        a. For original research, add rationales or theoretical frameworks for why a certain hypothesis is tested.
        b. If multiple predictions can be made for the same IV-DV combination, describe what outcome would be predicted by which theory. -->

# Methods

## Design*
<--List, based on your hypotheses from section A:
            i. Independent variables with all their levels
                1. Whether they are within- or between-participant
                2. The relationship between them (e.g., orthogonal, nested).
            ii. List dependent variables, or variables in a correlational design
            iii. Third variables acting as covariates or moderators.-->

## Planned Sample*
            <--i. If applicable, describe pre-selection rules.
            ii. Indicate where, from whom and how the data will be collected.
            iii. Justify planned sample size
            iv. If applicable, you can upload a file related to your power analysis here (e.g., a protocol of power analyses from G*Power, a script, a screenshot, etc.).
            v. Describe data collection termination rule.-->
Enter your response here
## Exclusion Criteria*
            <--i. Describe anticipated specific data exclusion criteria. For example:
                1. Missing, erroneous, or overly consistent responses;
                2. Failing check-tests or suspicion probes;
                3. Demographic exclusions;
                4. Data-based outlier criteria;
                5. Method-based outlier criteria (e.g. too short or long response times).-->
## Procedure*
            <--i. Describe all manipulations, measures, materials and procedures including the order of presentation and the method or randomization and blinding (e.g., single or double blind), as in a published Methods section. -->

# Analysis plan

## Confirmatory analyses 
<!--         a. Describe the analyses that will test the first main prediction from the hypotheses section. Include:
            i. The relevant variables and how they are calculated;
            ii. The statistical technique;
            iii. Each variable’s role in the technique (e.g., IV, DV, moderator, mediator, covariate);
            iv. Rationale for each covariate used, if any;
            v. If using techniques other than null hypothesis testing (for example, Bayesian statistics), describe your criteria and inputs toward making an evidential conclusion, including prior values or distributions.  -->

## Recommended Elements
<!--         a. Specify contingencies and assumptions, such as:
            i. Methods of correction for multiple tests.
            ii. The method of missing data handling (e.g., pairwise or listwise deletion, imputation, interpolation).
            iii. Reliability criteria for item inclusion in scale.
            iv. Anticipated data transformations.
            v. Assumptions of analyses, and plans for alternative/corrected analyses if each assumption is violated.             
            vi. Optionally, upload any files here that are related to your analyses (e.g., syntaxes, scripts, etc.).
                1. You may attach up to 5 files to this question. You may attach files that you already have in this OSF project, or upload a new file from your computer. Uploaded files will automatically be added to this project so that they can be registered.t-->
