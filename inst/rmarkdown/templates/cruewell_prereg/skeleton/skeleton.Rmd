# Study Information


## Description 
<!-- Briefly describe your study, giving some information on its background and purpose.
Example: While animals have been found to be able to reach optimality in the
speed-accuracy tradeoff, the evidence for humans is mixed. It is unclear whether
humans only do not act optimally by default, or whether they are unable to do so. Here,
we want to investigate this issue by giving participants time to practice, and varying the
amount of feedback they receive, to see if these affect whether they reach optimality in
the speed-accuracy tradeoff.
More info: Keep this description short – while it is helpful to give some context for your
project, you do not have to include a whole introductory section for the purposes of this
preregistration -->

## Hypotheses*
<!-- List the hypotheses to be tested. Ensure specificity, precisenesss, and exhaustiveness
by stating all your hypotheses/predictions as specifically and unambiguously as possible,
ideally also emphasising that you will only be testing these hypotheses in your
confirmatory analyses. Do specify if the hypotheses are directional or non-directional,
and state the direction if appropriate.
Example: We will test the following hypotheses only :
H1 With suitable practice and medium feedback, participants get closer to optimality with
each block of trials. (directional)
H2 After suitable practice and medium feedback, participants will have an approximately
optimal speed-accuracy trade-off. (directional)
H3 Participants who complete a fixed number of trials are closer to optimality than
participants who complete trials in a fixed amount of time. (directional) -->

## Codebook*
<!--Some studies (usually publically available) offer codebooks to describe their data. If such
a codebook is available, please link to it here or upload the document. -->

Enter your response here.


## Sampling and data collection procedures*
<!-- If the data collection procedure is already well documented, please provide a link to the
information. If the data collection procedure is not yet well documented, please describe,
to the best of your ability, how data were collected. What populations were sampled
from, what were the recruitment efforts, what was the procedure for running participants
through the study, were researchers blind to the research question, hypotheses or
conditions, was randomization of any kind used, etc?
Example: 70 participants were recruited at the University of Newcastle and completed
the experiment online, for which they received course credit. The participants were
randomly (and equally) divided into the two groups of fixed trials and fixed time. The
task used the random dot kinetogram, following Evans & Brown (2017) and Evans et al.
(2018) -->

## Prior work based on the dataset*
<!--Have you published/presented any previous work based on this dataset? Include
any publications, conference presentations (papers, posters), or working papers
(in-prep, unpublished, preprints) based on this data set that you have worked on.
Example: There does not exist prior work based on this data set. -->

Enter your response here.


## Prior Research Activity*
<!-- Describe any prior knowledge of the dataset. Be specific and transparent.
Example: We have already fit the model from Figure 1 [not included here] to the
data and checked the results from one of the groups that are not relevant for the
current study, and has run the model-based analyses using the model in Figure 2
[not included in example] and here also checked the consistency of the Bayes
factor approximation for one of the irrelevant groups. -->

Enter your response here.


# Sampling Plan

<!-- If you are using pre-existing data, you may delete this section. -->

## Data collection procedures*

<!-- Please describe your data collection process. If you are using human subjects, this
should include the population from which you obtain subjects, recruitment efforts,
payment for participation, how subjects will be selected for eligibility from the initial pool
(e.g. inclusion and exclusion rules), and your study timeline. For studies that do not
include human subjects, include information about how and for how long samples will be
collected, the source or location of samples, and/or the batch numbers you will use.
Example: Participants will be students recruited through advertisements at a university,
where they will receive course credit for their participation.
More information: The answer to this question should be specific enough that another
person could repeat the data collection procedures and recreate the study population.
Alternatively, if the study population would be unable to be reproduced because it relies
on a specific set of circumstances unlikely to be recreated (e.g., a community of people
from a specific time and location), the criteria and methods for creating the group and the
rationale for this unique set of subjects should be clear -->

Enter your response here.


## Sample size*
<!--Describe the sample size of your study. How many units will be analyzed in the study? If
the units are not individuals, then describe the size requirements for each unit. Eiter state
exact numbers or an expected range.
Example: Our target sample size is 70 participants. We will attempt to recruit up to 90, to
allow for exclusions. -->

Enter your response here.


## Sample size rationale
<!-- This could include an arbitrary constraint such as time, money, or personnel, power
analysis (if applicable), or an analysis based on a parameter recovery study.
Example: The number of subjects is based on a parameter recovery study.
More information: This gives you an opportunity to specifically state how the sample
size will be determined. A wide range of possible answers is acceptable; remember that
transparency is more important than principled justifications. Any pre-specified reasoning
behind the sample size is preferable to ambiguity and potential confusion for the reader -->

Enter your response here.


## Stopping rule
<!-- If you cannot pre-specify your sample size, specify a stopping rule, i.e., how you will
decide when to terminate your data collection.
Example: We will post participant sign-up slots by week on the preceding Friday night,
with 20 spots posted per week. We will post 20 new slots each week if, on that Friday
night, we are below 320 participants.
More information: Unacceptable rationales include stopping based on e.g. p-values if
checkpoints and stopping rules are not specified. If you have control over your sample
size, then including a stopping rule is not necessary, though it must be clear in this
question or a previous question how an exact sample size is attained. -->

Enter your response here.



# Design Plan
<!-- If you are using pre-existing data, you may delete this section. In this section, you will be asked
to describe the experimental design of your study. Remember that this research plan is
designed to register a single study, so if you have multiple experimental designs, please
complete a separate preregistration. Note that this is about experimental design; your modelling
design choices will be registered in a later section. -->

## Study type*
<!-- Please select one of the following options by deleting the others -->
A. Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this
includes field or lab experiments. This is also known as an intervention experiment
and includes randomized controlled trials.

B. Observational Study - Data is collected from study subjects that are not randomly
assigned to a treatment. This includes surveys, natural experiments, and regression
discontinuity designs. 

C. Other


## Blinding*
<!-- Blinding describes who is aware of the experimental manipulations within a study. Mark
all that apply.-->
A. No blinding is involved in this study.
B. For studies that involve human subjects, they will not know the treatment group to
which they have been assigned.
C. Personnel who interact directly with the study subjects (either human or non-human
subjects) will not be aware of the assigned treatments. (Commonly known as
“double blind”)
D. Personnel who analyze the data collected from the study are not aware of the
treatment applied to any given group. -->

## Additional blinding
<--Is there any additional blinding in this study?-->
Enter your response here.


## Experimental design*
<!-- Describe your experimental design.
Example: We have a 3 (feedback: low, medium, high) by 2 (fixed time, fixed trial) by 23
(practice block) design.
More info: This question has a variety of possible answers. The key is for a researcher
to be as detailed as is necessary given the specifics of their design -->

Enter your response here.


## Randomization
<!-- If you are doing a randomized study, how will you randomize, and at what level?
Example: We will use block randomization, where each participant will be randomly
assigned to one of the four equally sized, predetermined blocks. The random number list
used to create these four blocks will be created using the web applications available at
http://random.org.
More info: If randomization is required for the study, the method should be specified
here, not simply the source of random numbers. --> 

Enter your response here.


# Variables

<!-- In this section you can describe all variables that are manipulated and measured in your experiment. If you are using pre-existing data, you may delete this section. -->

## Manipulated variables
<!-- Describe all variables you plan to manipulate and the levels or treatment arms of each
variable. This is not applicable to any observational study.
Example: We manipulated the level of feedback given to participants, and whether they
completed trials in a fixed amount of time, or a fixed number of trials.
More information: For any experimental manipulation, you should give a precise
definition of each manipulated variable. -->

Enter your response here.


## Measured variables*
<!-- Describe each variable that you will measure.
Example: The outcome variables measured are reaction time and response accuracy.
More information: Observational studies will include only measured variables. As with
the previous questions, the answers here must be precise. -->

Enter your response here.


## Indices
<!-- If any measurements are going to be combined into an index (or even a mean), what
measures will you use and how will they be combined? Include either a formula or a
precise description of your method.
Example: For each cell and each individual, we will calculate mean response time and
accuracy.
More information: If you are using multiple pieces of data to construct a single variable,
how will this occur? Both the data that are included and the formula or weights for each
measure must be specified. Standard summary statistics, such as “means” do not
require a formula, though more complicated indices require either the exact formula or, if
it is an established index in the field, the index must be unambiguously defined. For
example, “biodiversity index” is too broad, whereas “Shannon’s biodiversity index” is
appropriate. -->

Enter your response here.

# Data Cleaning


## Data exclusion*
<!-- How will you determine what data (e.g., participants or trials), if any, will be excluded
from your analyses? How will outliers be handled? Will you use any awareness checks?
Example: For all participants, the first block of trials will be excluded to allow for
participants to become adequately practiced at the task. Trials with response times
below 150ms or above 10000ms will be excluded as anticipatory responses and trials
where participants lost attention, respectively. Participants with task accuracy below 60%
or less than 200 eligible trials (based on the number of trials required for accurate
parameter estimation) will be excluded.
More information: Any rule for excluding a particular set of data is acceptable. You may
describe rules for excluding a participant and/or for identifying outlier data. -->

Enter your response here.


## Missing data
<!--How will you deal with incomplete or missing data?
Example: If a subject does not complete the entire duration of the experiment, that
subject will not be included in the analysis.
More information: Any relevant explanation is acceptable. As a final reminder,
remember that the final analysis must follow the specified plan, and deviations must be
either strongly justified or included as a separate, exploratory analysis. -->

Enter your response here.


# Cognitive modelling

## Cognitive model*
Please include the type of model used (e.g. diffusion model, Linear ballistic accumulator
model), and a specific parameterisation/parameterisations.
Example: The parameters of a simple diffusion model will be estimated, namely only:
drift rate (v), starting point (z), threshold (a), non-decision time (ter). This differs from
[previous paper], where the full diffusion model was estimated, i.e., including
between-trial variability parameters for drift rate, starting point, and non-decision time.
These between-trial variability parameters are not relevant here, and without them, the
simple diffusion model has better parameter recovery results (Lerche & Voss, 2016).
Figure 1 shows a plate diagram of the hierarchical structure used for the qualitative
model-based analysis assessing 1) whether groups appear to get closer to optimality
over time, 2) whether each group differs from optimality, and 3) whether there appears to
be a difference between the groups (see Analysis Plan for more information); i indexes
participants, and j indexes blocks. Only the threshold parameter varies between blocks,
to estimate changes in the speed accuracy trade-off. More information: The architecture of the model should be pre-specified in a way that is
specific, precise, and exhaustive (as can be seen in the example above). In the given
example, we emphasise that ”only” the stated parameters will be estimated. To this end,
you should also ideally include a plate diagram as mentioned in the example (see e.g.,
Figure 1) and specify the relevant equations. Motivate your choices. Note: If you are
using e.g. Bayesian hierarchical modelling for parameter estimation, the structure of the
hierarchical model and the prior distribution over the parameters belong into this
parameterisation as well. -->

Enter your response here.


## Parameter estimation*
<!-- Please specify and motivate your method of parameter estimation.
Example: Only Bayesian hierarchical modeling will be used to estimate the parameters
of the diffusion model, constraining individual-level parameters to follow group-level
truncated normal distributions. For the estimation model (see Figure 1, the two groups
(fixed-trial and fixed-time) are given a separate hierarchical structure, and the
group-level parameters are not constrained between groups. We will use likelihood
functions taken from the ``fast-dm'' toolbox (Voss & Voss, 2007) for the calculation of the
density function of the simple diffusion model. For the first model, for sampling from the
posterior distributions over parameters, we will use Markov-chain Monte Carlo with
differential evolution proposals (Turner et al., 2013), using 66 chains, drawing 3,000
samples from each, and discarding the first 1,500 samples.
More information: If you are not interested in the parameters and are going straight to
statistical inference without estimating the parameters, please state this clearly and
motivate this choice. If you are using Bayesian methods, specify and motivate priors. In
general, specify as much as possible, including e.g. the starting point (distribution) for
estimation. If the data are going to be summarised into descriptive statistics, state which
descriptive statistics will be used, and how. -->

# Analysis plan

<!-- Please specify at least one confirmatory analysis. The confirmatory analyses described here have to be included in the final article, with a clear distinction from any additional exploratory analyses. This preregistration has to state up front which parameters are assessed, for example to vary across conditions. Only then is it a confirmatory analysis, otherwise it is exploratory. You may describe exploratory plans here, but a clear confirmatory analysis is needed. -->

## Statistical analyses
<!-- Specify the methods that will be used to test each hypothesis as precisely as possible. In
particular, specify the method(s) and process(es) of (statistical) inference and on which
parameters of interest you will be applying them. In the case of model-based analyses,
make sure to also include the relevant models in the Cognitive Modelling section above.
Keep in mind that any analyses not mentioned and specified in these confirmatory
sections have to be clearly labeled as exploratory in the final output.
Example: Our hypotheses will be quantitatively tested by means of only the following
tests:
Testing H2: Using only the second half of all 20 blocks (11-20, so as to account for
participants adjusting to the task), we will test whether each group, separately, differs
from optimality using Bayes factors, approximated with the Savage-Dickey Ratio on
𝜇c.
Testing H3: Again using only blocks 11-20, we will use the Savage-Dickey method on
𝛥c (𝛥c = 𝜇c1 - 𝜇c2) to test whether the groups differ in their distance from optimality.
More information: As with all of the other questions, the key is to provide a specific
recipe for analyzing the collected data. Ask yourself: is enough detail provided to run the
same analysis again with the information provided by the user? -->

Enter your response here.


## Other analyses
<!-- Specify any other confirmatory analyses you intend to perform.
Example: Testing H1/2/3: In addition to the statistical analyses listed above, we will
qualitatively compare the posterior distributions of the decision threshold parameters
(actual thresholds for each block as estimated using the model in Figure 1) against the
posterior predictive distributions for the optimal threshold calculated as above -->

Enter your response here.


## Inference criteria
<!--What criteria will you use to make inferences? Please describe the information you will
use (e.g. p-values, Bayes Factors, etc.), as well as a cut-off criterion, where appropriate.
Will you be using one or two tailed tests for each of your analyses? If you are comparing
multiple conditions or testing multiple hypotheses, will you account for this?
Example: These are the inference criteria for our analyses listed above:
1. Criterion for BF testing H2: Following Jeffreys (1961) for the interpretation of strength
of evidence given a Bayes Factor. If c = 0, the behaviour of the group is optimal, if c < 0
it is urgent, and if c > 0 it is cautious.
2. Criterion for BF testing H3: Following Jeffreys (1961) for the interpretation of strength
of evidence given a Bayes Factor. If
𝝙c = 0, the groups are the same regarding their
difference from optimality, and if
𝝙c < 0 or 𝝙c > 0, the groups differ in their distance from
optimality.
3. Criterion to test H1, qualitatively evaluating the plots comparing posterior to posterior
predictive distribution: If the actual thresholds of both (or one) group(s) clearly show a
trend towards optimality, we will conclude that participants move towards optimising the
speed-accuracy trade-off. Otherwise, our conclusion will be suitably less strong and
discuss any lack of clarity. -->

Enter your response here.


## Exploratory analysis
<!-- Describe any exploratory analyses you expect to do.
Example: We are currently not planning any exploratory analyses.
More information: An exploratory test is any test where a prediction is not made up
front, or there are multiple possible tests that you are going to use. A statistically
significant finding in an exploratory test is a great way to form a new confirmatory
hypothesis, which could be registered at a later time. It is crucial to clearly distinguish
confirmatory from exploratory results in your final article. -->

Enter your response here.


# Robustness checks
## Robustness Checks and Sensitivity Analyses*
<--Please specify any planned robustness checks and/or sensitivity analyses, if any. If a
parameter recovery study was performed, please report its results and your
conclusions here.
Example: The key analysis will be replicated a) including participants/trials that were
initially excluded in line with our exclusion criteria, and b) using a model in which the
threshold parameter and the drift rate parameter vary across blocks. Their results will be
mentioned alongside the key results, and interpreted accordingly. If these results show a
lack of robustness, this will be an interesting outcome worthy of further investigation.
More information: This section ensures that robustness checks and parameter
recovery simulations are not performed and/or reported selectively. It is important to note
that, given the preregistration of modelling and analyses, it should be clear that any lack
of robustness is at least not due to post-hoc, data-driven choices. -->

Enter your response here.


# Contingency plans
<!-- Please specify any and all contingency plans to ensure that your preregistration plan is
robust to common issues. There is no need to cover every eventuality, but if possible, try
and cover some of these common issues suggested here, and/or issues that you
commonly encounter. Contingency plans may be easiest to specify precisely when
phrased as the broader issue (e.g., whether or not the data are captured well), the more
specific conditions that will be assessed to determine whether the contingency plan is
activated (e.g., the specific trends in the data that will be assessed for sufficient fit), and
the contingency plan -- or plans -- that will be used.
Example: A) Issue – The model fits poorly to the data; Condition – The model is unable
to capture some specific trend(s) in the data that are deemed important a-priori, such as
specific response time quantiles; Contingency Plan – A different, preregistered
parameterisation of the same model, or a different model altogether, which you believe
will be able to account for these trends.
B) Issue – The sampling algorithm does not appear to be effectively searching through
the parameter space; Condition – The search algorithm appears to be getting stuck in
certain areas of the parameter space and gives different answers for different runs;
Contingency Plan – A different preregistered sampling algorithm, or perhaps a different
preregistered parameterisation of the model that may have a parameter space that is
easier to search. C) Issue: The proposed methods end up taking more time than
planned; Condition – Executing the originally preregistered plans would take a month of
computing time; Contingency Plan – A preregistered version that is simpler, such as a
reduced version of the model, or a simpler method of performing inference. -->
