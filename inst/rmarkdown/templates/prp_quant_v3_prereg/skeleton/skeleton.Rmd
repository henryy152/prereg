## Measured variables, manipulated variables, covariates

It is important to specify for each hypothesis how it is operationalized, i.e., which variables will be used to test the respective hypothesis and how the hypothesis will be operationally defined in terms of these variables. The description here shall be consistent with the statistical analysis plans specified in the analyses section.-->

# Analysis plan


## Criteria for post-data collection exclusion of participants
<!--Describe all criteria that will lead to the exclusion of a participant's data (e.g. performance criteria, non-responding in physiological measures, incomplete data). Be as specific as possible (e.g., detail cut-offs, use of list- or case-wise exclusion). Clarify whether a participant who is an outlier in one variable will only be excluded from the analyses that involve that specific variable, or if they will be excluded from all tests.-->

Enter your response here 

## Criteria for post-data collection exclusions on trial level
<!--Describe all criteria that will lead to the exclusion of a trial or item (e.g. statistical outliers, response time, reliability scores, incorrect trials). Be as specific as possible.--> 

Enter your response here 

## Exhaustiveness of exclusion criteria
<!--Confirm that the above information is complete before proceeding. Whichever option you choose, adding additional exclusion criteria at a later date is a deviation from this preregistration.-->
* All exclusion criteria (on the participant and trial level) that are currently planned are listed above.
* Not all exclusion criteria are listed above.
- Please explain why some exclusion criteria are not described:

## Data preprocessing
<!--Describe all data manipulations that are performed in preparation of the main analyses (e.g., calculation of variables or scales, recoding, any data transformations, preprocessing steps for imaging or physiological data). If applicable, refer to your publicly accessible standard lab procedure.-->

Enter your response here

## Data cleaning and screening
<!--Indicate all steps related to data quality control (e.g., testing assumptions, outlier treatment, interrater reliability training, checks for normality).-->

Enter your response here 

## How will missing data be handled?
<!--Indicate any procedures that will be applied during the analysis to deal with missing data, such as (a) case deletions; (b) averaging across scale items (to handle missing items for some); (c) test of missingness (MAR, MCAR, MNAR assumptions); (d) imputation procedures; (e) intention to treat analysis and per protocol analysis (as appropriate).-->

Enter your response here 

## Reliability analysis (if applicable)
<!--Specify the type of scale reliability that will be estimated, whether it is internal consistency (e.g. Cronbach's alpha, omega), test-retest reliability, or some other form (e.g., a confirmatory factor analysis incorporating multiple factors as sources of variance). In a study involving measure development, researchers should specify criteria for removing items from measures a priori (e.g., largest factor loading magnitude, smallest drop in alpha-if-item removed).-->

Enter your response here

## Descriptive statistics
<!--Specify which descriptive statistics will be calculated for which variables (refer to the variables specified in the previous section). If descriptive statistics are linked to specific hypotheses in the introduction section, explicitly link the information given here to the respective hypothesis.-->

Enter your response here

## Statistical models
<!--If you test hypotheses in your study: Specify the statistical model (e.g. t test, ANOVA, LMM) that will be used to test each of your hypotheses. Give all necessary information about model specification (e.g., variables, interactions, planned contrasts) and follow-up analyses. Include model selection criteria (e.g., fit indices), corrections for multiple testing, and tests for statistical violations, if applicable.-->

Enter your response here

## Inference criteria
<!--If you test hypotheses in your study: Specify the criteria used for inferences (e.g., p values, Bayes factors, confidence intervals, effect size measures) and the thresholds for accepting or rejecting your hypotheses. If possible, define the smallest effect size of interest. If inference criteria differ between hypotheses, specify separately for each hypothesis and respective statistical model by explicitly referring to the numbers of the hypotheses. Describe which effect size measures will be reported and how they are calculated-->

Enter your response here 

## Exploratory analysis
<!--Based on the exploratory research questions outlined in the introduction section, describe any exploratory analyses to be conducted with your data. Include any planned analyses that are not confirmatory in the sense of being a direct test of one of the specified hypotheses. Please note that other non-registered exploratory analyses can be added in the article.-->
